# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Yocosi

### I also really like software engineering.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C/C++ systems programming

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm 27 and I went back to school in 2020 to learn computer science just because I met an Indian Guy who was coding at a Bo's coffee in the Philippines when i was working as a freelance in digital marketing.
