# Hi developers/recruiters ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Pierre Amari

### I also really like software engineering and game engine development.


- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on a NES emulation with 6502 Assembly.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: yocosi.dev@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I went back to school to learn computer science just because I met an Indian Guy who was coding at a Bo's coffee in the Philippines when i was working as a freelance in digital marketing.
